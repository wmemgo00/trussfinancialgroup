# Truss Financial Group: Flexible Mortgage Solutions for Self-Employed Borrowers, Investors, and Non-Traditional Income Earners

So you're trying to get a mortgage, and you're running into the same frustrating wall everyone hits: you don't fit the traditional W-2 mold. Maybe you run your own business, maybe you flip houses, or maybe you're retired with plenty in the bank but no regular paycheck. Whatever your situation, you keep hearing "sorry, we can't help you" from conventional lenders. That's where the conversation about alternative lending gets interesting.

Truss Financial Group has carved out something of a reputation in the mortgage world, particularly for people who live outside the lines of traditional employment. Based in Southern California and operating since 2006, they've built their entire business around a simple idea: not everyone who can afford a house looks good on paper to a traditional bank. In fact, they were recently ranked as the #2 Non-QM lender in the nation by Scotsman Guide in 2025, which tells you they're handling serious volume in this space.

**What Makes Truss Financial Different From Your Average Lender**

Walking into a traditional bank with anything other than a W-2 and two years of tax returns often feels like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. You know you can afford the mortgage, but the paperwork just doesn't tell your story. Truss Financial Group operates in what's called the Non-QM space, which is industry speak for "non-qualified mortgage." That doesn't mean unqualified—it just means these loans don't follow the standard Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac playbook that conventional lenders stick to religiously.

The company focuses on several specialized loan types that sound complicated but actually make a lot of sense when you understand what they're for. DSCR loans, for instance, let real estate investors qualify based on whether a property can cover its own mortgage payment through rental income. You don't need to prove your personal income at all. Bank statement loans look at your actual cash flow over 12 or 24 months instead of asking for tax returns that might show write-offs reducing your stated income. Asset depletion loans let you qualify based on what you have in savings or investments rather than what you earn each month.

The company has built specific products for specific problems, which means there's a decent chance one of them lines up with exactly what you need.

**The Real Numbers: What Truss Financial Offers**

Let's talk specifics, because generalities don't help when you're trying to figure out if you can actually get a loan. Based on current information and recent announcements, here's what the landscape looks like with Truss Financial Group:

For DSCR loans, which are probably their bread and butter, you're typically looking at needing at least 20% down, though some programs accept as low as 15% in certain states. Your credit score needs to be at least 620, though 680 or higher gets you better rates. The interesting thing about DSCR loans is that the property itself is doing the qualifying. If the rental income covers 1.25 times the mortgage payment, you're golden. Truss even works with properties that have a DSCR below 1.0, down to 0.75, which is pretty rare—most lenders won't touch anything under 1.0.

Bank statement loans are another big category. These work for self-employed people who write off a lot of their income for tax purposes but actually have strong cash flow. Truss looks at 12 to 24 months of business bank deposits and calculates your qualifying income from there, usually around 50-75% of the deposits depending on the program. You still need decent credit, typically 620 minimum, and you're looking at 10-20% down depending on the specifics of your situation.

Here's a rough breakdown of what you might expect across different loan types:

| Loan Type | Minimum Credit Score | Typical Down Payment | Income Documentation | Loan Amounts | Who It's For |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| DSCR Loan | 620+ (680+ preferred) | 15-25% | None (property income only) | Up to $3M+ | Real estate investors with rental properties |
| Bank Statement Loan | 620+ | 10-20% | 12-24 months bank statements | Varies by market | Self-employed, business owners, freelancers |
| No-Doc HELOC | 680+ | N/A (existing equity required) | None | Up to 85% CLTV | Homeowners needing cash, self-employed |
| Asset Depletion | 680+ | 20-30% | Asset statements only | Conforming to jumbo | Retirees, high net worth individuals |
| Stated Income | 680-700+ | 20-30% | Borrower states income | Varies | Entrepreneurs, complex income situations |
| Hard Money/Bridge | 620+ | 20-30% | Minimal | Up to 90% acquisition | Fix-and-flip investors, bridge financing |

Interest rates for Non-QM loans typically run higher than conventional mortgages because of the increased risk to lenders. In the current market (early 2026), conventional rates hover around 5.9% to 6.3%, while DSCR and bank statement loans might be anywhere from 6.5% to 8.5% depending on your credit profile, down payment, and the specific property. That spread might feel steep, but for many borrowers, it's the difference between getting a loan or not getting one at all.

The company has been expanding aggressively into the HELOC space, particularly with their no-documentation options. Their Digital HELOC product lets qualified borrowers access up to 85% of their home's value using just bank statements, with no tax returns or W-2s required. They're also launching DSCR HELOCs in 2026, which let real estate investors tap equity in rental properties based purely on the property's rental income. These typically close in 15 to 30 days, which is fast for real estate financing.

**Who Actually Uses These Loans?**

The customer reviews paint an interesting picture. You see a lot of real estate investors who own multiple properties and got tired of fighting with traditional lenders about debt-to-income ratios that don't account for rental income properly. You see self-employed people who have thriving businesses but whose tax returns don't look impressive because they're aggressive about writing off expenses. You see retirees who have plenty of money in investment accounts but don't have regular paychecks anymore.

One pattern that shows up repeatedly in the testimonials is people who had been turned down by two or three other lenders before finding Truss. Someone refinancing an inherited rental property out of state. A business owner who needed to prove income through bank statements rather than tax returns. A retiree who wanted a HELOC but couldn't verify traditional income. These are the situations where Truss seems to do their best work.

The company has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, though they're not BBB accredited. On Yelp and their own testimonial page, you see consistent themes: responsive loan officers, relatively quick closings (30 days seems typical for purchases, faster for HELOCs), and a willingness to work with complex situations. The complaints that do exist often center around rates being higher than conventional loans, which is inherent to the Non-QM space, or occasional miscommunications during the process, which happens with any mortgage lender.

Different programs have different qualification sweet spots, and knowing where you fit saves a lot of time.

**The Process: What It's Actually Like to Get a Loan**

So how does this actually work if you decide to move forward? The process isn't wildly different from a conventional loan, but there are some key differences in what documentation you'll need.

For a DSCR loan, you're providing information about the property—rent rolls, lease agreements, or market rent analyses—rather than piles of personal financial documents. The underwriter is calculating whether the property can carry itself, not whether your paycheck can carry it. This makes the process simultaneously simpler and more property-focused than a traditional mortgage.

For bank statement loans, you're pulling 12 to 24 months of business bank statements and having them analyzed by the lender. They're looking at deposits, calculating average monthly income, and applying a percentage (often 50-75%) as your qualifying income. This bypasses the need for tax returns entirely, which is the whole point for self-employed borrowers who write off significant expenses.

For asset depletion loans, you're documenting your liquid assets—retirement accounts, investment portfolios, savings accounts—and the lender is calculating how those assets could theoretically be depleted over the loan term to create qualifying income. You're not actually touching the assets; it's just a mathematical exercise to show you have the resources to make payments.

The timeline varies by loan type and property type. HELOCs can close in as little as 15 days if everything's straightforward. Purchase loans typically take 30 to 45 days. More complex scenarios—fix-and-flip bridge loans, commercial properties, unusual property types—might take longer as they work through underwriting.

Interest rates get locked when you're ready to commit, just like with conventional loans. You can sometimes float and watch rates, or you can lock immediately if you're comfortable with what you're offered. Rate locks typically last 30 to 60 days, which should be enough time to close if you keep the process moving.

**The Investment Property Angle**

One area where Truss has particularly deep expertise is investment property financing. The DSCR loan structure was essentially designed for real estate investors who own multiple properties and can't qualify for more conventional loans because their debt-to-income ratios look terrible on paper, even though their properties are all cash-flowing nicely.

Think about it: if you own five rental properties, each with its own mortgage, a traditional lender looks at all that debt and gets nervous. But if each property is generating more rent than its mortgage costs, you're not actually over-leveraged—you're running a profitable real estate business. DSCR loans recognize this reality by qualifying each property independently based on its own numbers.

The company works with everything from single-family rentals to small multifamily properties (2-4 units typically), short-term rentals like Airbnb properties, and even some commercial real estate scenarios. They've developed hybrid STR programs that blend the property's rental income with your personal income, which helps with properties that have seasonal occupancy or irregular booking patterns.

They also handle fix-and-flip scenarios through their bridge loan and hard money programs. These are short-term loans, usually 12 to 24 months, designed to buy properties quickly, renovate them, and then sell or refinance into permanent financing. You can get funding up to 90% of the acquisition price in some cases, and rehab draws can be rolled into the loan so you're not paying out of pocket for renovations.

For serious investors building portfolios, these programs can be what makes the business model work. Traditional lenders often cap you at 10 financed properties, but Non-QM lenders like Truss don't have the same limitations. If your properties perform well and you have decent reserves, you can keep growing.

If you're actively building or managing a rental property portfolio and need financing that scales with your business, now might be a good time to have that conversation with someone who understands investor lending. 👉 [Connect with Truss Financial Group](https://trussfinancialgroup.com?fpr=li86) to discuss portfolio lending strategies that might not be available through your local bank. The dynamics of investor financing are different enough that specialized knowledge actually matters.

**The Self-Employed Borrower Challenge**

Let's spend a minute on the self-employed angle because this is where a huge chunk of frustrated borrowers end up. You run a successful business, you make good money, but your tax returns show minimal income because you're smart about business deductions. You write off your vehicle, your home office, your business meals, your equipment—all the things you're supposed to write off. The result is that your taxable income looks low, which tanks your mortgage application even though your business is thriving.

Bank statement loans solve this by looking at what's actually flowing through your business accounts. The lender can see the deposits, see the business activity, and calculate qualifying income from the gross rather than the net. It's a more accurate picture of your ability to make mortgage payments.

The typical formula uses 50% of deposits for personal bank statements or 75% of deposits for business bank statements, though this varies by program and lender. Some programs require 12 months of statements, others require 24 months. The longer the track record, the more confidence the lender has in the consistency of your income.

These loans work for a wide range of self-employed people: contractors, freelancers, small business owners, commission-based salespeople, gig economy workers with multiple income streams, and anyone else whose tax returns don't reflect their true earning power. The key is having a consistent pattern of deposits over time that demonstrates your income isn't wildly erratic.

**The Retiree and High-Net-Worth Situation**

Another group that benefits from alternative lending is retirees who have significant assets but limited traditional income. Social Security and pension income often isn't enough to qualify for the mortgage you want, but you've got $500,000 in your IRA and another $300,000 in a brokerage account. Traditional lenders struggle with this, but asset depletion loans handle it elegantly.

The math is straightforward: take your total liquid assets, divide by the number of months in the loan term, and that's your monthly "income" for qualification purposes. You're not actually liquidating anything or moving money around—it's purely a calculation to show you have the resources to make payments. The assets stay exactly where they are, continuing to grow (hopefully) and remain available for your actual retirement needs.

This works for various scenarios: retirees who want to downsize or relocate, people taking early retirement before pension or Social Security kicks in, high-net-worth individuals who structure their finances to minimize taxable income, and anyone else with significant assets but low traditional income.

Truss also offers specialized HELOC programs for seniors (Truss Equity Select) designed for borrowers 55 and older. These can be particularly useful for accessing home equity for renovations, healthcare costs, or bridging gaps before Social Security or required minimum distributions from retirement accounts begin.

**Market Context and Rate Environment**

It's worth understanding where we are in the broader market. Mortgage rates have been elevated since the Federal Reserve started raising rates in 2022, and while they've pulled back from their peaks, they're nowhere near the pandemic-era lows that made everyone feel like money was free. Conventional mortgages in early 2026 are running around 5.9% to 6.3%, depending on credit profile and down payment.

Non-QM rates naturally run higher—typically 50 to 200 basis points (0.5% to 2%) above conventional rates. So if conventional is at 6%, you might be looking at 7% to 8% for a DSCR or bank statement loan. That spread reflects the additional risk lenders take on when they can't verify income through traditional channels.

For some borrowers, that rate premium is a dealbreaker. For others, it's simply the cost of access—you pay a bit more, but you get the loan. And in many cases, you can refinance later once your financial picture looks more traditional or rates come down. Non-QM loans generally don't have prepayment penalties, so you're not locked in forever.

The company publishes current rates on their website, though specifics depend heavily on your individual situation. Credit score, down payment, loan-to-value ratio, property type, and loan purpose all factor into the rate you'll actually get. The only way to know for sure is to run your numbers through their system.

**What to Watch Out For**

No lender is perfect, and it's worth understanding both the advantages and limitations of working with a Non-QM specialist like Truss Financial Group.

The most obvious consideration is cost. Non-QM loans come with higher rates and sometimes higher fees than conventional loans. If you can qualify for a conventional loan, that's probably your better move financially. The question is whether you can qualify for conventional—if you can't, then comparing Non-QM rates to conventional rates is kind of pointless. You're comparing to other Non-QM options, not to loans you can't get.

Documentation requirements, while different from conventional loans, still exist. You're not getting away with providing nothing—you're just providing different things. Bank statements, asset statements, property information, credit authorization, all the standard stuff still applies. It's not a "no questions asked" situation.

Some loan programs have limitations on property types or locations. Not every exotic property scenario will work. Co-ops can be tricky. Properties in rural areas might face restrictions. Properties with significant deferred maintenance or title issues could be problems. The more straightforward your property is, the smoother the process typically goes.

The approval process, while focused on different factors than conventional loans, still involves underwriting and verification. You can still get conditions, requests for additional documentation, or complications if something unexpected comes up. The difference is what's being scrutinized, not whether scrutiny exists.

**Making the Decision**

So is Truss Financial Group the right fit for your situation? That depends entirely on what you're trying to accomplish and what your alternatives are.

If you're a real estate investor with rental properties and you're tired of fighting traditional lenders about debt-to-income ratios, DSCR loans might be exactly what you need. If you're self-employed with strong cash flow but tax returns that don't reflect your earning power, bank statement loans could be your path forward. If you're retired with significant assets but minimal regular income, asset depletion loans might make sense. If you own a home with substantial equity and need access to cash without refinancing your low-rate first mortgage, their HELOC programs could be perfect.

On the flip side, if your financial situation is straightforward—W-2 income, clean tax returns, good credit—you can probably get better rates with a conventional lender. Non-QM loans are for when conventional doesn't work, not when it's simply one option among many.

The company's ranking as the #2 Non-QM lender nationally suggests they're doing serious volume and have experience with these specialized scenarios. That institutional knowledge matters when you're dealing with something outside the conventional playbook. You want a lender who's seen your situation before and knows how to structure it correctly.

Customer reviews consistently mention responsive loan officers and relatively smooth processes once the documentation is submitted. The closing times—typically 30 to 45 days for purchases, faster for refinances and HELOCs—are competitive with conventional lenders despite the different underwriting focus.

The bottom line is this: if conventional lending isn't working for you, alternative options exist. Truss Financial Group has built their entire business around those alternatives, which means they have both the products and the experience to handle situations that make traditional lenders uncomfortable.

Whether that's worth the rate premium and different qualification requirements depends on your specific situation, your long-term plans, and what other options you have available. For many borrowers who fall outside the conventional box, the question isn't whether to pay a bit more—it's whether to get a loan at all. In that context, Non-QM lending isn't just a more expensive option; it's often the only option.

If you're ready to explore whether these alternative lending pathways might work for your situation, having an actual conversation with someone who knows the products is probably your next step. 👉 [Get started with Truss Financial Group](https://trussfinancialgroup.com?fpr=li86) to see which programs you might qualify for and what the real numbers look like in your specific case. Sometimes the best way to figure out if something makes sense is to run the numbers and see what comes back.
